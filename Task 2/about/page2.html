		<p>We aspire to a life more flavorful, more colorful and more delicious. We are students of the world of tea—respecting its ancient traditions and reimagining them for new tea enthusiasts. Teavana became part of the Starbucks family in 2012. Tea has always been part of Starbucks heritage—the company was founded as Starbucks Coffee, Tea and Spices in 1971. Our goal to share the vibrance of super-premium tea with more people is well underway. And there are many opportunities for you to take part in it.</p>
