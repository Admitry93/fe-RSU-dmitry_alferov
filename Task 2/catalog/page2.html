		<p>The term "red tea" has two very different meanings. This dual meaning sometimes causes confusion amongst people who drink one type of "red tea" or the other.

In the West, the more common meaning for "red tea" is rooibos, which is actually a type of tisane or herbal infusion. Rooibos is a naturally caffeine-free herbal "tea" with a red color and a sweet, woodsy, earthy flavor that some say is similar to black tea. Due to its sweet flavor, rooibos is used in many dessert teas and masala chai blends.</p>
